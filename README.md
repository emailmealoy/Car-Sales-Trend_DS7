**Project Overview:**

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize trends in the car sales market using the "Car Sales Report" dataset. Our team aims to uncover insights into sales performance across different brands, models, body types, fuel types, and price segments. By leveraging Python-based visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly in a Jupyter Notebook environment, we intend to present clear and actionable visual narratives that highlight key market dynamics.
This project demonstrates our ability to work collaboratively on a data visualization challengeâ€”handling real-world datasets, applying exploratory data analysis techniques, and designing effective visual representations that can guide decision-making.

**Target Audience:**

- Automotive Dealership Executives looking to identify high-performing car brands and models for strategic stocking and sales decisions.
- Marketing and Sales Analysts who want to understand consumer purchasing patterns and seasonality trends across different car types and price ranges.
