### Understanding the Data

### Data Cleaning
After reviewing the dataset for common issues such as missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent formatting. Some columns, like Engine, included special characters that needed to be removed, while the Date column was converted into a standard format to allow for time-based analysis. We also ensured that numeric fields like Price ($) and Annual Income were properly typed and free from invalid entries.

### Data Exploration
With a clean dataset, we began exploring trends and patterns using summary statistics and visualizations.
