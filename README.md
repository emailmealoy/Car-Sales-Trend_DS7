 # Purpose and Overview

 The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize trends in the car sales market using the "Car Sales Report" dataset. Our team aims to uncover insights into sales performance across different brands, models, body types, fuel types, and price segments. 
 
 The project was processed with help of classification modelling to understand the impact of demographic factors on the popularity of a specific car model based on historical purchase data. The features, which were used for the predictions are following: gender, annual income.
 
 The dataset shows that there are some possible risks/biases, which are important to mention:
 - The income feature depends on the gender, which affects customer ability to afford a specific range of the car. The statistics says that women earn 18% less on average than men in the USA. ([source](https://www.epi.org/blog/gender-pay-gap-2024/))
 - There could be a possibility when a car is bought by a parent or a partner for the person of the opposite gender. The dataset doesn't provide enough of details to analyze this possibility and its impact on the prediction.
 - The limited demographic data (gender and income) could cause less accurate prediction. Such factors as age, marriage status, and amount of kids can affect the trend as well.
 These potential risks can affect and limit the reliability of our conclusions.

 By leveraging Python-based visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly in a Jupyter Notebook environment, we intend to present clear and actionable visual narratives that highlight key market dynamics.

 # Project Scope
 
 ## Description

 This project involves conducting classification analysis on customer demographic and historical purchase data to identify key factors that predict customerâ€™s purchase preference for specific car categories (e.g. SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, Luxury, etc). Data splitting  and performance metrics are used to validate and ensure reliability of the analysis. Additionally, we will provide insights and recommendations for sales and product management strategies based on the findings.

 ## Stakeholders
 - **Sales Teams** â€“ Optimize inventory and customer interaction strategy.
 - **Marketing Teams** â€“ Use predictions for targeted campaigns and promotions.
 - **Product Managers** - Guide future product offerings and customer segmentation.
 - **Business Executives** â€“ Make strategic decisions based on customer behavior analytics


 # Understanding the Data
 ## Data Exploration
 With a clean dataset, we began exploring trends and patterns using summary statistics and visualizations. 

 - ```Car_id:``` 23,906 Unique identifier

 - ```Date:``` Date of sale - January, 2022, to December 2023

 - ```Customer Name, Gender, Annual Income:``` Customer demographics
    * Total Unique Customers: 3,022
    * Gender Breakdown: 
 _This skew suggests a strong male majority in recorded customer profiles._
        * Male: 18,798 (~79%)
        * Female: 5,108 (~21%)
    * Annual Income:
 _Income distribution is wide, indicating a diverse customer base from lower to high-income groups._
        * Minimum: $10,080
        * Maximum: $11,200,000
        * Mean: $830,840
        * Median (50%): $735,000
 - ```Company, Model, Engine, Transmission, Color, Body Style:``` Vehicle specifications
    * Total Unique Companies: 30
    * Total Unique Models: 154
    * Engine Types (2 total): 2
        * Double Overhead Camshaft: 12,571
        * Overhead Camshaft: 11,335
    * Transmission Types: 2
        * Automatic (Auto): 12,571
        * Manual: 11,335
    * Total Unique Colors: 3
    * Total Unique Body Styles: 5

 - ```Price ($):``` Final sale price
    * Price Range: $1,200 â€“ $85,800

 - ```Dealer_Name, Dealer_No, Dealer_Region:``` Dealer details
    * Total Unique Dealers: 28
    * Total Unique Dealer Numbers: 7
    * Total Unique Dealer Regions: 7

 - ```Phone:``` Customer contact (anonymized numeric field)

 > ### SUVs were the most popular body style

 > ### Automatic transmissions dominated sales across all regions

 > ### Brands like Toyota, Ford, and BMW consistently appeared among the top sellers

 > ### Car prices varied significantly based on model, region, and customer income level

This exploration guided us in choosing the most relevant features for our later visualizations and predictive modeling, and gave us a solid understanding of the automotive sales landscape reflected in the data.


 # Data Cleaning
 After reviewing the dataset for common data quality issuesâ€”such as missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent formattingâ€”several adjustments were made. For example, the "Engine" column contained special characters that were removed to ensure consistency. The "Date" column was converted to a standardized format to enable time-based analysis. Additionally, numeric fields like "Price ($)" and "Annual Income" were checked to ensure they were correctly typed and free of invalid or non-numeric entries.

 Data validation of the "Gender" column revealed significant inconsistencies between gender-indicative names and the corresponding gender values. This suggests that the gender information was likely self-reported, possibly collected through an online form or survey. In such cases, individuals may have entered the gender they personally identify with, rather than one inferred by external criteria. Additionally, the dataset's source is listed as "Internet" on Kaggle, which supports the assumption that the gender values reflect user-provided, self-identified information.

 Data review prior cleaning was processed in SQL and Python to ensure clean and smooth process of prediction.

 #### Tools used in SQL:
 - REPLACE
 - COUNT
 - DISTINCT
 - UNION
 - CTE
 - TEMP TABLE
 - CROSS JOIN
 - math operations (AVG, MIN, MAX, etc.)

 #### Tools used in Python:
 - pd.to_datetime
 - .strftime
 - .nunique
 - .value_counts
 - .describe
 - .items
 - matplotlib.pyplot (for pre-analysis visualization)

 # Data Analysis
 Linear classification model
Why We Chose to Use a Machine Learning Model
Our project aims to identify key factors that influence a customer's preference for specific car categories (e.g., SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, etc.). While exploratory data analysis and visualizations helped us uncover general trends and correlations, we chose to build a Logistic Regression classification model to strengthen the insights in the following ways:

Predictive Power:
By using a classification model, we can predict which car category a potential customer is likely to purchase based on their demographic and purchase history. This is valuable for sales and marketing teams to tailor their strategies.

Interpretability:
Logistic Regression offers clear insights into which features (e.g., income, region, engine type) are most influential in shaping customer preferences. This supports data-driven decision-making for product planning and dealership targeting.

Business Value:
The model provides actionable insights that go beyond historical trends â€” enabling personalized product recommendations and segmentation strategies, which are critical for automotive businesses aiming to optimize customer engagement.

Portfolio Strength:
Incorporating a machine learning model demonstrates our teamâ€™s capability to move from data analysis to predictive modeling, an important skill set for data science roles.

By balancing accuracy with interpretability, the model enhances our projectâ€™s impact while staying aligned with our original business question and stakeholder needs.
